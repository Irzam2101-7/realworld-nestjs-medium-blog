## Roadmap

1. **Add Clap Feature for Articles**

   - **Database**: Add a `clap` table with the following columns: `id`, `article_id` (foreign key), `user_id` (foreign key), and `counter`, with a composite primary key on `article_id` and `user_id`.
   - **API to Clap an Article**: Create an API endpoint that allows users to clap for an article. Each clap will increment the counter associated with the user and article.
   - **Get Articles API Update**: Modify the existing "get articles" API to include the total clap count for each article, aggregating claps from all users.
